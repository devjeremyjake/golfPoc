## 🚀 Next Steps

### Install & Setup

**Option 1: Automated (Recommended)**

```bash
chmod +x setup-screen-recording.sh
./setup-screen-recording.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual**

```bash
# 1. Install package
npm install react-native-record-screen

# 2. Install iOS dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# 3. Prebuild (REQUIRED!)
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 4. Run the app
npx expo run:ios
```

### First Run

1. Launch the app
2. Tap the recording button (4th button, looks like 🔴)
3. Grant microphone permission
4. Grant photo library permission
5. Recording starts!

---

## 🎨 How It Works

### Recording Button Location

```
MenusControl buttons:
[+]  [⊞]  [📷]  [🔴]  [⋮]
                 ↑
          Recording Button
          (4th button)
```

### Visual Feedback

- **White button** = Not recording
- **Red button** = Recording in progress

### What Gets Recorded

Everything in the View (lines 1536-1789):

- ✅ Both video frames with playback
- ✅ All canvas drawings (shapes, lines, arrows, etc.)
- ✅ Camera overlay (if open)
- ✅ All animations and interactions
- ✅ Audio from microphone

---

## 📊 Technical Specs

### Recording Quality

- **Resolution**: Native screen resolution
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS
- **Bitrate**: 5 Mbps (high quality)
- **Audio**: High quality, synced
- **Format**: MP4 (iOS), WebM (Android)

### Performance

- **Memory**: ~100-200MB during recording
- **CPU**: Optimized native implementation
- **Battery**: Moderate drain during recording
- **Storage**: ~50-100MB per minute

### Platform Support

- **iOS**: ✅ Uses ReplayKit (best quality)
- **Android**: ✅ Uses MediaProjection

---

## 🔐 Permissions Required

Auto-requested on first use:

- 🎤 Microphone (for audio recording)
- 📸 Photo Library (to save recordings)
- 💾 Media Library Write (to create albums)

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Short recordings**: Keep under 5 minutes for best performance
2. **Close other apps**: Free up memory before recording
3. **Check storage**: Ensure sufficient space
4. **Test first**: Do a quick 5-second test recording

### Troubleshooting

| Issue                  | Solution                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Module not found       | Run `npx expo prebuild --clean`         |
| No audio               | Check microphone permission in Settings |
| Recording doesn't save | Check photo library permission          |
| Button doesn't respond | Check console for errors                |

## 🎓 Code Highlights

### Hook Initialization (Entry.tsx)

```typescript
import { useScreenRecorder } from './hooks/useScreenRecorder';

const { isRecording, toggleRecording } = useScreenRecorder();
```

### Button Connection (MenusControl.tsx)

```typescript
<Pressable onPress={toggleRecording}>
	<RecordingSvg color={isRecording ? '#FF5E5C' : '#FFFFFF'} />
</Pressable>
```

### Recording Logic (useScreenRecorder.ts)

```typescript
// Start recording with audio
await RecordScreen.startRecording({
	mic: true,
	fps: 30,
	bitrate: 5000000,
});
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### First Install

After installing `react-native-record-screen`, you **MUST** run:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

This is required because it's a native module.

### iOS Specific

- Recording uses Apple's ReplayKit
- Creates "Golf POC" album in Photos
- Best quality and performance

### Android Specific

- Shows permission dialog on first use
- Saves to default video folder

---

## 🔧 Customization

Want to change recording settings? Edit `hooks/useScreenRecorder.ts`:

```typescript
await RecordScreen.startRecording({
	mic: true, // false to disable audio
	fps: 60, // 15, 30, or 60
	bitrate: 8000000, // Higher = better quality
});
```

Quality presets:

- **Low**: fps: 15, bitrate: 1000000
- **Medium**: fps: 30, bitrate: 3000000
- **High**: fps: 30, bitrate: 5000000 ✅ (current)
- **Ultra**: fps: 60, bitrate: 8000000
